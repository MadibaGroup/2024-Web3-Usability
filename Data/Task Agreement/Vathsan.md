Vathsan Core Tasks

1. Install MetaMask wallet extension on desktop browser.

2. Create a new wallet address and confirm its balance as zero. This task involves creating a new password for the wallet and configuring the initial set of Ethereum networks (blockchains) to connect with.

3. Fund wallet address with ERC-20 tokens. This task can be completed by receiving tokens from another wallet address, by buying tokens on MetaMask using a debit/credit card, or by transfering tokens from an exchange.

4. Connect DApp to user's wallet and confirm the address connected on the DApp. This task involves logging in to the wallet extension (if not logged in already) and selecting a wallet address.

5. Configure wallet to connect to a desired blockchain network (if it is not already on this network). This network has to be supported by the DApp to perform transactions. The supported networks may be different on each DApp. 

6. Successfully complete transactions on the DApp. This involves approving transaction requests on the user's wallet to transfer tokens to the DApp's contract. For instance, a user on Uniswap performs the following steps:

    1. Specify the desired tokens for the exchange.

    2. Initiate exchange transaction on the DApp and determine the expected gas fees.

    3. Approve transaction by signing token transfer request to DApp's contract and confirm that the tokens have been exchanged.

7. Disconnect the wallet
