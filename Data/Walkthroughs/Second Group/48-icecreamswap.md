T1. Proceed to connect wallet to website with a practical mental model (G1-G3) of what connecting means, why the process is what it is (different web3 apps might use different processes), understanding and avoiding risks (G4-G5), and confirming connection is successful (G3) (via the website and via MetaMask).

- Connecting to wallet immediately triggers network switch to `Core Blockchain Mainnet`. 

T2. Configure wallet to connect to a desired blockchain network (start from mainnet Ethereum). This network has to be supported by the DApp to perform transactions. The supported networks may be different on each DApp.

- Simple option to choose a supported network.

T3. Conduct an operation of the web3 site that does require wallet approval, configure and sign the transaction, understand and avoid risks. Covers token balances, gas fees, approvals, signature, confirming transaction, etc.

- Swap trx asks for unlimited approval.

- Shows `Add to wallet` option after trasaction completes.


T4. Revert, to the extent possible, any past interactions with the DApp. Disconnect the wallet, unapprove tokens, etc. 

- Disconnect option doesn't disconnect site from the wallet (i.e., can reopen site and connect wallet without approving in the wallet)
