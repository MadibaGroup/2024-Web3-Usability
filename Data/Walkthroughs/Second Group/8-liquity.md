## Core Task 01

*Proceed to connect wallet to website with a practical mental model (G1-G3) of what connecting means, why the process is what it is (different web3 apps might use different processes), understanding and avoiding risks (G4-G5), and confirming connection is successful (G3) (via the website and via MetaMask).*

- Connect wallet option is simple. Shows the (partial) wallet address and the balance after connection is successful.

## Core Task 02

*Configure wallet to connect to a desired blockchain network (if it is not already on this network). This network has to be supported by the DApp to perform transactions. The supported networks may be different on each DApp.* 

- Unclear if the site only supports Ethereum Mainnet as there is no option to change network on the site (G1).

## Core Task 03

*Conduct an operation of the web3 site that does require wallet approval, configure and sign the transaction, understand and avoid risks. Covers token balances, gas fees, approvals, signature, confirming transaction, etc.*

- The site operates using its native tokens and provides options to buy tokens by directing users to other platforms.
    - selecting to buy LUSD directs to curve.fi which shows 404 error page and no instructions on proceeding (G2).
    - selecting to buy LQTY directs to uniswap.

## Core Task 04

*Revert, to the extent possible, any past interactions with the DApp. Disconnect the wallet, unapprove tokens, etc.* 

- No disconnect option on the dapp. Only "change" wallet option is displayed.
