T1. Proceed to connect wallet to website with a practical mental model (G1-G3) of what connecting means, why the process is what it is (different web3 apps might use different processes), understanding and avoiding risks (G4-G5), and confirming connection is successful (G3) (via the website and via MetaMask).

- Simple option to connect wallet. Shows (partial) wallet address after connecting.

T2. Configure wallet to connect to a desired blockchain network (start from mainnet Ethereum). This network has to be supported by the DApp to perform transactions. The supported networks may be different on each DApp.

- Multiple warnings when switching to `BNB` or `Base` networks from the site.

T3. Conduct an operation of the web3 site that does require wallet approval, configure and sign the transaction, understand and avoid risks. Covers token balances, gas fees, approvals, signature, confirming transaction, etc.

- Swap trx ony BNB chain. Shows confirmation after trx is submitted/completed.

T4. Revert, to the extent possible, any past interactions with the DApp. Disconnect the wallet, unapprove tokens, etc. 

- Clicking on the button showing wallet address appears to disconnect wallet (i.e., shows the connect wallet button again). But it doesn't disconnect site from the wallet (i.e., can reopen site and connect wallet without approving in the wallet)
