T1. Proceed to connect wallet to website with a practical mental model (G1-G3) of what connecting means, why the process is what it is (different web3 apps might use different processes), understanding and avoiding risks (G4-G5), and confirming connection is successful (G3) (via the website and via MetaMask).

- Simple option to connect wallet. Shows the user's name tag and wallet balance.

- Simple prompt to select a supported network.

- Selecting `BNB Chain` triggers wallet prompt with multiple warnings.

T3. Conduct an operation of the web3 site that does require wallet approval, configure and sign the transaction, understand and avoid risks. Covers token balances, gas fees, approvals, signature, confirming transaction, etc.

- after swp trx, the site shows an option to "add BUSD to MetaMask"


T4. Revert, to the extent possible, any past interactions with the DApp. Disconnect the wallet, unapprove tokens, etc. 

- Disconnect option is simple and removes site from the wallet.
